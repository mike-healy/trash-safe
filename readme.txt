Require confirmation before deleting items from the Trash, or emptying the whole Trash. Protects against accidental clicks.

== Description ==
If you use the WordPress admin area on a mobile device, or have cats sometimes walk across your keyboard it can be good to have a fail-safe confirmation before permanently deleting posts from the Trashed items.
This plugin adds simple JS to the admin area to do just that.
